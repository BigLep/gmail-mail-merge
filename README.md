# Gmail/Sheets Mail Merge

Enhanced mail merge script for Google Apps Script that sends personalized emails using Gmail drafts as templates and Google Sheets for recipient data.

## Features

- Use Gmail draft messages as email templates
- Support for rich text content including emojis and HTML formatting
- Multiple recipients per row (comma-separated format) 
- Template variable substitution using `{{variable}}` syntax
- File attachments support
- Email tracking with sent status column
- Error handling and logging
- Uses MailApp for reliable emoji/Unicode handling

## Setup

1. Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet
2. Set up your data with column headers including:
   - `Recipient`: Email addresses (can be comma-separated for multiple recipients)
   - `Email Sent`: Status column (leave blank initially)
   - Any other columns for template variables (e.g., `Name`, `Company`, etc.)

3. Go to Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
4. Delete the default code and paste the contents of `mail-merge.gs`
5. Save the project

## Usage

### 1. Create Email Template
1. In Gmail, create a new draft message
2. Write your email using `{{ColumnName}}` syntax for variables
3. Example: "Hi {{Name}}, thanks for your interest in {{Company}}!"
4. Save as draft (don't send)

### 2. Set Up Spreadsheet Data
Example spreadsheet format:
```
Recipient                           | Name    | Company | Email Sent
user1@example.com                   | John    | Acme    |
user2@example.com,user3@example.com | Jane    | Corp    |
```

### 3. Run Mail Merge
1. In Google Sheets, you'll see a "Mail Merge" menu appear
2. Click "Mail Merge" ‚Üí "Send Emails"
3. Enter the subject line of your Gmail draft
4. The script will send personalized emails and update the "Email Sent" column

## Multiple Recipients

You can specify multiple email addresses in the `Recipient` column by separating them with commas:
- `user1@example.com,user2@example.com,user3@example.com`
- The first email becomes the primary recipient (TO)
- Additional emails are added as CC recipients
- All recipients receive the same personalized message

## Rich Text and Emojis

The script uses MailApp for reliable Unicode/emoji support:
- HTML formatting (bold, italic, colors, etc.)
- Unicode characters and emojis üéâ (excellent handling with MailApp)
- File attachments
- Note: Inline images become regular attachments (MailApp limitation)

## Template Variables

Use `{{ColumnName}}` in your email draft to insert data from your spreadsheet:
- `{{Name}}` - inserts value from "Name" column
- `{{Company}}` - inserts value from "Company" column
- Any column header can be used as a variable

## Error Handling

- Failed emails will show error messages in the "Email Sent" column
- Successfully sent emails show the timestamp
- Re-running the script skips already sent emails
