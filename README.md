## Setup

1. Open Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet
2. Set up your data with column headers including:
   - `Recipient`: Email addresses (can be comma-separated for multiple recipients)
   - `Email Sent`: Status column (leave blank initially)
   - Any other columns for template variables (e.g., `Name`, `Company`, etc.)

3. Go to Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
4. Delete the default code and paste the contents of `mail-merge.gs`
5. Save the project

## Usage

### 1. Create Email Template
1. In Gmail, create a new draft message
2. Write your email using `{{ColumnName}}` syntax for variables
3. Example: "Hi {{Name}}, thanks for your interest in {{Company}}!"
4. Save as draft (don't send)

### 2. Set Up Spreadsheet Data
Example spreadsheet format:
```
Recipient                           | Name    | Company | Email Sent
user1@example.com                   | John    | Acme    |
user2@example.com,user3@example.com | Jane    | Corp    |
```

### 3. Run Mail Merge

#### Option A: Send Emails Directly
1. In Google Sheets, you'll see a "Mail Merge" menu appear
2. Click "Mail Merge" ‚Üí "Send Emails"
3. Enter the subject line of your Gmail draft
4. The script will send personalized emails and update the "Email Sent" column

#### Option B: Create Draft Emails (Recommended)

2. Enter the subject line of your Gmail draft template
3. The script creates personalized drafts in your Gmail drafts folder
4. Review each draft manually before sending
5. Spreadsheet shows "Draft created [timestamp]" in the status column

## Draft vs Send Modes

### Draft Mode Benefits (Recommended)
- **Review before sending**: Check each personalized email manually
- **Full Gmail features**: Inline images, rich formatting, all Gmail options
- **Error prevention**: Catch template issues before mass sending
- **Emoji support**: Better Unicode handling through GmailApp drafts
- **Flexible sending**: Send drafts individually or in batches

### Send Mode Benefits  
- **Automation**: Fully automated sending process
- **Reliable emojis**: Uses MailApp for consistent Unicode encoding
- **Bulk processing**: Send all emails in one operation
- **Simple workflow**: One-click sending without manual review

## Multiple Recipients

You can specify multiple email addresses in the `Recipient` column by separating them with commas:
- `user1@example.com,user2@example.com,user3@example.com`
- The first email becomes the primary recipient (TO)
- Additional emails are added as CC recipients
- All recipients receive the same personalized message

## Rich Text and Emojis

The script uses MailApp for reliable Unicode/emoji support:
- HTML formatting (bold, italic, colors, etc.)
- Unicode characters and emojis üéâ (excellent handling with MailApp)
- File attachments
- Note: Inline images become regular attachments (MailApp limitation)

## Template Variables

Use `{{ColumnName}}` in your email draft to insert data from your spreadsheet:
- `{{Name}}` - inserts value from "Name" column
- `{{Company}}` - inserts value from "Company" column
- Any column header can be used as a variable

## Error Handling

- Failed emails will show error messages in the "Email Sent" column
- Successfully sent emails show the timestamp
- Re-running the script skips already sent emails

## Contributing

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.

Example: `feat: add support for BCC recipients`

## Why did I spend time on this?

You'd think mail merge from gmail would be totally solved problem at this point, but in 202509, I still hit issues:
* [GMail first class support](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/12921167?hl=en)
  * üëé Required paying for Google Workspace.  I was ok to do this because could get it for 14 days free.
  * üëé It ended up not identifying the columns in my spreadsheet correctly and insisting on a name, when I just want a column with one or more emails concatenated in a given cell if I wanted to sent to multiple people.
* Mail Merge for Gmail
  * üëé To remove their branding from emails means a paid plan, and paid play is annual, so like $36 a year.
* Yet Another Mail Merge
  * I have used this in the past and it works great, but..
  * üëé Free plan limited to 20 recipients per day, and I had 100 to send to.
